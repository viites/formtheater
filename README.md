# Safa Theatre Club - Theatre Club Signup Form

A beautiful theatre club signup form with responsive design.

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)

To serve this site on GitHub Pages:

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository
- Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
- Name it `your-username.github.io` (for user site) or any name for a project site
- Initialize with this README

### 2. Push Your Files
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages
- Go to your repository Settings → Pages
- Set Source to "Deploy from a branch"
- Select `main` branch and `/root` folder
- Your site will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/` (or your repo name)

## Files Included
- `safa.html` - Main signup form
- `style.css` - Styling
- `server.js` - Optional local development server (run with `node server.js`)

## Local Development
To test locally before pushing to GitHub:
```bash
node server.js
```
Then visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Notes
- The site is fully static (HTML, CSS)
- GitHub Pages will serve it automatically - no server needed
- The `server.js` file is optional for local testing only
